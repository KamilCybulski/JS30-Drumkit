# JS30-Drumkit
JavaScript drumkit

========= Important notes<br>
-This is a little project that I've done for a JS30 course (https://javascript30.com/).
-I'm not a musician, the selection of audio files doesn't really make sense to be honest. The point wasn't to create functional tool,
 it was just an excersize.
-I'm also not a designer. I'm pretty sure you can tell. Again, the point was to practice vanilla JS, didnt want to focus too much on other
 stuff. Still, markup and CSS took me about 4 times more, then the actual script. Or something like that.
 
 
========== Instructions<br>
 The idea is pretty simple. On the upper panel you have 6 buttons, described as 'loops'. Pressing any of them will play a longer audio
 file, that will keep replaying itself, unitll you press a key again. This is supposed to toggle on and off some sort of "background music"
 
 On the lower panel, you have buttons for the short sounds. Pressing a button will just play a sound once. 
 
 So far this supports only keyboard. I'll make a tablet-friendly version soon. 
 This kind of stuff isn't really supposed to be used on mobiles (too many buttons to fit them on small screen - and you want the entire
 thing on just one screen). Therefore the site isn'y really adjusted for mobiles.
